        My name is Kelly.

        I was once was asked, "What is your passion?" I replied, "My passion is to find all my passions." This list is incredibly long and multifaceted.

        But of all the interests and hobbies, my favorite is learning. Whether it's learning lyrics to a new song, moves to a new dance,
        or a fun fact to add to my plethora of useless knowledge... I just absolutely love growing.

        A few of you may have been forwarded here from my Instagram page and have always wondered what I do for a living.
        Well, you're kind of looking at it. I am a web developer. Currently, I work for a software company that is the creator of an enterprise content
        management system. Don't worry, I won't bore you with that. Instead, I'd rather welcome you to something I've been working on personally for fun
        and the love of learning.
